## Project Overview

The American WAKE experimeNt (AWAKEN) is a comprehensive wind energy field campaign combining advanced atmospheric sensing, multi-scale wake measurements, and coordinated validation efforts across 12+ national laboratories, universities, and industry partners. As Co-Investigator and Lead Coordinator, I directed this $28M+ DOE-funded effort to improve understanding of wind plant wake dynamics and atmospheric physics.

## My Role & Contributions

- **Campaign Coordination**: Directed deployment logistics, data management protocols, and cross-institutional collaboration for 18-month intensive measurement campaign at two operating wind plants in Oklahoma
- **Measurement Strategy**: Architected multi-scale sensing network combining ground-based lidars, profiling systems, acoustic tomography, and in-situ tower measurements to capture wake evolution from rotor scale to wind plant scale
- **Data Infrastructure**: Led development of 200+ TB validation-quality dataset with standardized formatting, quality control procedures, and open-access distribution framework
- **Scientific Leadership**: Coordinated interdisciplinary research teams investigating wake meandering, atmospheric stability effects, turbine-wake-atmosphere interactions, and model validation

## Technical Innovations

AWAKEN deployed unprecedented sensing capabilities:
- 40+ scanning Doppler lidars capturing three-dimensional wake structure
- Acoustic tomography arrays reconstructing volumetric wind and temperature fields
- Instrumented meteorological towers with high-frequency turbulence measurements
- Coordinated scanning strategies enabling simultaneous multi-platform observations

## Impact

AWAKEN's datasets are being used internationally for wind energy model validation, supporting:
- Wake model development and validation across academic, national lab, and industry communities
- Uncertainty quantification frameworks for wind plant performance prediction
- Advanced control strategy development and testing
- Weather and wake forecasting system improvements

The campaign's open-data approach has enabled 50+ institutions to use AWAKEN measurements in computational model validation, machine learning algorithm development, and fundamental turbulence research.

## Funding & Partnerships

- **Funding**: $28M+ from DOE Wind Energy Technologies Office
- **Duration**: 2019-2024 (planning, execution, analysis)
- **Partners**: NREL, Sandia National Laboratories, PNNL, University of Colorado Boulder, Texas Tech University, NOAA, DTU Wind Energy, plus industry collaborators including NextEra Energy
