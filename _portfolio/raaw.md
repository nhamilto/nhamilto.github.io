## Project Overview

The Rotor Aerodynamics, Aeroelastics, and Wake (RAAW) experiment is a collaboration between NREL and GE Vernova to better understand the physics governing wind turbine wake generation, evolution, and recovery. As Principal Investigator, I lead this $8M+ project combining highly-instrumented commercial turbines with advanced remote sensing to connect blade loading, structural dynamics, and wake behavior.

Through partnership with GE Vernova, RAAW benefited from access to:
- Industry experts on the design, control, and operation of utility scale wind turbines
- Production turbine control systems and operational setpoints
- Validated aeroelastic models for multi-physics simulation and benchmarking
- Real-world testing environment for advanced measurement and control strategies

This collaboration accelerates technology transfer from fundamental research to grid-scale deployment, directly impacting wind plant economics.


## Scientific Goals

RAAW addresses critical knowledge gaps in wind turbine aerodynamics:
- **Rotor-Wake Coupling**: How do blade pitch, yaw, and structural dynamics influence near-wake formation?
- **Wake Meandering**: What drives large-scale wake wandering and how does it affect downstream turbine performance?
- **Load Validation**: Can we validate aeroelastic simulation tools using coordinated wake and turbine operational data in a dynamic sense (second by second)?

## Technical Approach

RAAW deployed cutting-edge measurement systems:
- **Instrumented Turbines**: Blade root strain gauges, nacelle loads, high-frequency SCADA, and blade pitch/yaw controllers providing millisecond-resolution operational data
- **Multi-Lidar Array**: 6+ scanning Doppler lidars capturing three-dimensional wake structure from near-wake to 10+ rotor diameters downstream
- **Tower Measurements**: High-frequency velocity, temperature, and turbulence statistics for model validation
- **Photogrammetry**: Target-tracking of more than 150 unique points distributed on rotor blades and tower providing unique defelection and torsion measurements

## Funding & Partnerships

- **Funding**: $8M+ from DOE Wind Energy Technologies Office
- **Duration**: 2021-2025
- **Key Partner**: GE Vernova (formerly GE Renewable Energy)
- **Collaborators**: NREL, Sandia National Laboratories, University of Colorado Boulder

## Future Directions

RAAW data will support:
- Physics-informed machine learning for wake prediction
- Digital twin development for wind plant operations
- Uncertainty quantification frameworks for turbine loading
- Next-generation wind plant control optimization
